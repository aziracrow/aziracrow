<b>i like</b>
cell of empireo, deadpool, welcome home, 8:11, & good omens
<br>here's <a href="https://rentry.co/-spiderman">an extended list</a> with most of my interests if you're curious
<br><br>also, <b>whisper to interact</b> since i'm often offtab & might not notice
<br>i may be shy at first but i usually warm up to people pretty fast!
<br>i tend to joke a lot, so don't take most things i say seriously
<br><br><b>if you're younger than 15, keep interactions to a minimum.</b>
<br>i don't mind if you take inspo from my ponies, its a horse game!
